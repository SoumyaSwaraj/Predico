# Predico - The General Disease Prediction based on symptoms provided by patient- powered by Django & Machine Learning

## Abstract
In this era of  IT, technology has revolutionized the health domain to  
a  great  extent.  This  project  aims  to  design  a  diagnostic  model  for  various  dis- 
eases relying on their symptoms. This System has used data mining techniques 
such  as  classification  in  order  to  achieve  such  a  model.  Datasets  consisting  of 
voluminous  data  about patient diseases  are  gathered, refined and  classified  and 
were used for training the intelligent agent. Here, the Naive Bayes Algorithm is 
used  for  classification  purpose.  Na√Øve  Bayes  Classifier  calculates the  probabil- 
ity of the disease. Based on the result, the patient can contact the doctor accord- 
ingly for further  treatment. It's an  exemplar where  technology and health 
knowledge are sewn into a thread perfectly with a desire to achieve "prediction 
is better than cure".
